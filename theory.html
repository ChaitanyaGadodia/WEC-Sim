<h2>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Modeling a WEC involves the interaction between the incident waves, device motion, PTO mechanism, and mooring (Figure XXXX). WEC-Sim uses a radiation and diffraction method [Li2012][Babarit2012] to predict power performance and design optimization. The radiation and diffraction method generally obtains the hydrodynamic forces from a frequency-domain boundary element method (BEM) solver using linear coefficients to solve the system dynamics in the time domain.</p>

<h2>Boundary Element Method<a class="headerlink" href="#boundary-element-method" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A common approach to determining the hydrodynamic forces is to presume that they are the sum of incident, radiated, and diffracted wave components. These forcing components are modeled using linear coefficients ideally obtained from a frequency-domain potential flow BEM solver (e.g., WAMIT [Lee2006], AWQA-FER [AQWA], and Nemoh [NEMOH]). The BEM solutions are obtained by solving the Laplace equation for the velocity potential, which assumes the flow is inviscid, incompressible, and irrotational. More details on the theory for the frequency-domain BEM can be found in [Lee2006].</p>

<h2>Coordinate System in WEC-Sim<a class="headerlink" href="#coordinate-system-in-wec-sim" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The figure below illustrates a 3-D floating point absorber subject to incoming waves in water. The figure also defines the coordinates and the 6 DOF in WEC-Sim. The WEC-Sim coordinate system  assumes that the  X axis is in the direction of wave propagation if the wave heading angle is equal to zero. The Z axis is in the vertical upwards direction, and the Y axis direction is defined by the right-hand rule. In the vectors and matrices used in the code, surge (x), sway (y), and heave (z) correspond to the first, second and third position respectively. Roll (Rx), Pitch (Ry), and Yaw (Rz) correspond to the fourth, fifth, and sixth position respectively.</p>

<h2>Time-Domain Numerical Method<a class="headerlink" href="#time-domain-numerical-method" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The dynamic response of the system was calculated by solving the equation of motion for WEC systems [Babarit2012][Nolte2014]:. The equation of motion for a floating body, about its center of gravity, can be given as:</p>
<div class="math">
\[m\ddot{X}=F_{ext}+F_{rad}+F_{PTO}+F_{v}+F_{B}+F_{m},\]</div>
<p>where <span class="math">\(\ddot{X}\)</span> is the (translational and rotational) acceleration vector of the device, <span class="math">\(m\)</span> is the mass matrix, <span class="math">\(F_{ext}\)</span> is the wave excitation force vector, <span class="math">\(F_{rad}\)</span> is the force vector resulting from wave radiation, <span class="math">\(F_{PTO}\)</span> is the PTO force vector, <span class="math">\(F_{v}\)</span> is the viscous damping force vector, <span class="math">\(F_{B}\)</span> is the net buoyancy restoring force vector, and <span class="math">\(F_{m}\)</span> is the force vector resulting from the mooring connection.</p>
<p>Both <span class="math">\(F_{ext}\)</span> and <span class="math">\(F_{rad}\)</span> are calculated from values provided by the frequency-domain BEM solver. The radiation term includes an added-mass and wave damping term associated with the acceleration and velocity of the floating body, respectively. The wave excitation term includes a Froude-Krylov force component generated by the undisturbed incident waves and a diffraction component that results from the presence of the floating body. WEC-Sim can be used for regular and irregular wave simulations, but note that <span class="math">\(F_{ext}\)</span> and <span class="math">\(F_{rad}\)</span> are calculated differently for sinusoidal steady-state response scenarios and random sea simulations. The sinusoidal steady-state response is often used for simple WEC designs with regular incoming waves. However, for random sea simulations or any simulations where fluid memory effects of the system are essential, the convolution integral method is recommended to represent the fluid memory retardation force on the floating body.</p>
<div class="section" id="sinusoidal-steady-state-response-scenario">
<h3>Sinusoidal Steady-State Response Scenario<a class="headerlink" href="#sinusoidal-steady-state-response-scenario" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>This approach assumes that the system response is in sinusoidal steady-state form, and is only valid for regular wave simulations. The radiation term can be calculated using the added mass and the wave radiation damping term for a given wave frequency, which is obtained .. from</p>
<div class="math">
\[F_{rad}=-A(\omega_{r})\ddot{X}-B(\omega_{r})\dot{X},\]</div>
<p>where <span class="math">\(A(\omega_{r})\)</span> and <span class="math">\(B(\omega_{r})\)</span> are the added-mass and wave radiation damping matrices, respectively. <span class="math">\(\omega_{r}\)</span> is the wave frequency (in rad/sec), and <span class="math">\(\dot{X}\)</span> is the velocity vector of the floating body.</p>
<p>The free surface profile is based on linear wave theory for a given wave height, wave frequency, and water depth. The regular wave excitation force is obtained from</p>

<h3>Convolution Integral Formulation<a class="headerlink" href="#convolution-integral-formulation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>

<p>where <span class="math">\(A_{\infty}\)</span> is the added mass matrix at infinite frequency and <span class="math">\(K\)</span> is the impulse response function.</p>
<p>For regular waves, Eq. XXXXX is used to calculate the wave excitation force. For irregular waves, the free surface elevation is constructed from a linear superposition of a number of regular wave components. It is often characterized using a wave spectrum (Figure ref{fig:An-example-of PM Spectrum}) that describes the wave energy distribution over a range of wave frequencies, characterized by a significant wave height and peak wave period. The irregular excitation force can be calculated as the real part of an integral term across all wave frequencies as follows</p>
<div class="math">

<h3>Wave Spectrum<a class="headerlink" href="#wave-spectrum" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The ability to generate regular waves provides an opportunity to observe the response of a model under specific conditions. Sea states with constant wave heights and periods are rarely found outside wave tank test. Normal sea conditions are more accurately represented by random-wave time series that model the superposition of various wave forms with different amplitudes and periods. This superposition of waves is characterized by a sea spectrum. Through statistical analysis, spectra are characterized by specific parameters such as significant wave height, peak period, wind speed, fetch length, and others. The common types of spectra that are used by the offshore industry are discussed in the following sections.  The general form of the sea spectrums available in WEC-Sim is given by:</p>
<div class="math">
\[S\left( f \right) = A f^{-5}\exp\left[-B f^{-4} \right]~~,\]</div>
<p>where <span class="math">\(f\)</span> is the wave frequency (in Hertz) and <span class="math">\(\exp\)</span> stands for the exponential function.</p>
<div class="section" id="pierson-moskowitz">
<h4>Pierson&#8211;Moskowitz<a class="headerlink" href="#pierson-moskowitz" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>One of the simplest spectra was proposed by [PM]. It assumed that after the wind blew steadily for a long time over a large area, the waves would come into equilibrium with the wind. This is the concept of a fully developed sea, where a &#8220;long time&#8221; is roughly 10,000 wave periods, and a &#8220;large area&#8221; is roughly 5,000 wave-lengths on a side.  The spectrum is calculated from</p>
<div class="math">
\[S\left( f \right) = \frac{\alpha_{PM}g^{2}}{\left( 2 \pi \right)^{4}}f^{-5}\exp\left[-\frac{5}{4} \left( \frac{f_{p}}{f}\right)^{4} \right]~~\]\[A = \frac{\alpha_{PM}g^{2}}{\left( 2 \pi \right)^{4}},\]\[B = \frac{5}{4} {f_{p}}^{4}~~\]</div>
<p>where <span class="math">\(\alpha_{PM}\)</span> = 0.0081, <span class="math">\(g\)</span> is gravitational acceleration, and <span class="math">\(f_{p}\)</span> is the peak frequency of the spectrum.  However, this spectrum representation does not allow the user to define the significant wave height.  To facilitate the creation of a power matrix, in WEC-Sim the <span class="math">\(\alpha_{PM}\)</span> coefficient was calculated such that the desired significant wave height of the sea state was met.  The <span class="math">\(\alpha_{PM}\)</span> fit was calculated as follows:</p>
<div class="math">
\[\alpha_{PM} = \frac{H_{m0}^{2}}{16\int_{0}^{\infty} S^{*} \left( f \right) df}~~\]\[S^{*}\left( f \right) = \frac{ g^{2} }{ (2\pi)^{4}} f^{-5}\exp\left[-\frac{5}{4} \left( \frac{f_{p}}{f}\right)^{4} \right]~~\]</div>
<p>Note that related to the spectrum is a series of characteristic numbers called the spectral moments. These numbers, denoted <span class="math">\(m_{k}~,~k=0, 1, 2,...\)</span> are defined as</p>
<div class="math">
\[m_{k} = \int_{0}^{\infty} f^{k} S \left( f \right) df ~~.\]</div>
<p>The spectral moment, <span class="math">\(m_{0}\)</span> is the variance of the free surface, which allows one to define</p>
<div class="math">
\[H_{m0} = 4 \sqrt{m_{0}}~~.\]</div>

<div class="section" id="bretschneider-spectrum">
<h4>Bretschneider Spectrum<a class="headerlink" href="#bretschneider-spectrum" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>This two-parameter spectrum is based on significant wave height and peak wave frequency.  For a given significant wave height, the peak frequency can be varied to cover a range of conditions including developing and decaying seas. In general, the parameters depend on wind speed (most important), wind direction, as well as fetch and locations of storm fronts. The spectrum is given as</p>
<div class="math">
\[S\left( f \right) = \frac{{H_{m0}}^2}{4}\left(1.057f_{p}\right)^{4}f^{-5}\exp\left[-\frac{5}{4} \left( \frac{f_{p}}{f}\right)^{4} \right],\]\[A =\frac{{H_{m0}}^2}{4}\left(1.057f_{p}\right)^{4} \approx \frac{5}{16} {H_{m0}}^2 {f_{p}}^{4},\]\[B = \left(1.057f_{p}\right)^{4} \approx \frac{5}{4} {f_{p}}^{4}~~,\]</div>

<h2>Viscous Drag<a class="headerlink" href="#viscous-drag" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Generally, the effect of viscosity on the WEC dynamics needs to be considered as neglecting this effect may lead to an overestimation of the power generation of the system, particularly when a linear model is applied. A common way of modeling the viscous damping is to add a (Morison-equation-type) quadratic damping term to the equation of motion;</p>

The viscous drag coefficient for the device must be carefully selected [Li2012][Babarit2012]; however, it is dependent on device geometry, scale, and relative velocity between the body and the flow around it. The drag coefficient becomes much larger when the Reynolds and the Keulegan-Carpenter number are smaller. Note that empirical data on the drag coefficient can be found in various literature and standards. The available data may, however, be limited to existing simple geometries. For practical point absorber geometry, the hydrodynamic forces may have to be evaluated by conducting wave tank tests or prescribed motion computational fluid dynamic simulations.</p>
