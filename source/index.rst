`WEC-Sim (Wave Energy Converter SIMulator) <https://github.com/WEC-Sim/WEC-Sim>`_ 
====================================================================================

WEC-Sim (Wave Energy Converter SIMulator) is an open-source wave energy converter (WEC) simulation tool. The code is developed in MATLAB/SIMULINK using the multi-body dynamics solver SimMechanics. WEC-Sim has the ability to model devices that are comprised of rigid bodies, power-take-off systems, and mooring systems. Simulations are performed in the time-domain by solving the governing WEC equations of motion in 6 degrees-of-freedom. The WEC-Sim project is funded by the U.S. Department of Energy’s Wind and Water Power Technologies Office and the code development effort is a collaboration between the `National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) <http://www.nrel.gov/water/>`_ and `Sandia National Laboratories (SNL) <http://energy.sandia.gov/energy/renewable-energy/water-power/technology-development/wec-sim-wave-energy-converter-simulator/>`_.
