Mooring Modeling
------------------------------
Floating WEC systems are often connected to mooring lines to keep the device in position. WEC-Sim allows the user to model the mooring dynamics in the simulation by specifying the mooring matrix or coupling with MoorDyn. To include mooring connections, the user can use the mooring block (i.e., Mooring Matrix block or MoorDyn block) given in the WEC-Sim library under the mooring lib and connect it between the body and the Global reference frame. Please see the following Tutorial subsection for more information.
